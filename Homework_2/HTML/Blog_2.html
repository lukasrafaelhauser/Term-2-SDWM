                    One of the most surfer-friendly countries on the planet and one of the best places to learn to surf, Portugal welcomes aspiring surfers as well as pros to have a taste of its epic surf spots.
                    The central coast boasts some of the most powerful surf breaks in Europe. This is the home of Nazaré, the biggest wave ever surfed, and Peniche, with its legendary Supertubos beach break, Portugal’s own ‘Pipeline’. Ericeira, the only World Surf Reserve in Europe, and the surf beaches near Lisbon, Europe’s answer to San Francisco, welcome surfers of all levels.
                    Last but not least, the sunny and picturesque Algarve region, with its year-round warm water and reliable surfing conditions, offers something for all skill levels throughout the year.
